# Building Generic Slash Commands in Claude Code

## Overview

This guide documents the process for creating generic `/` commands in Claude Code that can be reused across different contexts. This approach allows for building flexible, parameterized commands that can adapt to various use cases.

## What Are Slash Commands?

Slash commands in Claude Code are custom prompts that start with `/` and are saved as Markdown files. They allow you to create reusable prompt templates that can be invoked quickly with arguments.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Command Structure
- Slash commands are stored as `.md` files in the Claude configuration directory
- The filename determines the command name (e.g., `compact.md` creates `/compact`)
- Commands can accept arguments that are passed when invoked

### 2. Generic Design Principles
- **Parameterization**: Use placeholders for variable content
- **Context Awareness**: Design commands to work with current file/project context
- **Flexibility**: Allow arguments to modify behavior
- **Reusability**: Create commands that work across different projects

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Command Purpose
Before creating a command, clearly define:
- What task it should accomplish
- What inputs it needs
- How it should behave in different contexts
- What outputs are expected

### Step 2: Create the Command File
Create a new `.md` file in your Claude configuration directory:

```bash
# Location varies by system, typically:
# ~/.claude/commands/ or ~/.config/claude/commands/
touch ~/.claude/commands/your-command-name.md
```

### Step 3: Write the Command Template
Structure your command with:
- Clear instructions for Claude
- Parameter placeholders
- Context-aware elements
- Expected behavior descriptions

Example template structure:
```markdown
# Command Name

## Purpose
Brief description of what this command does.

## Parameters
- `{param1}`: Description of first parameter
- `{param2}`: Description of second parameter

## Instructions
Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this command.

## Context Usage
How the command should use current file/project context.
```

### Step 4: Handle Arguments
Claude Code passes arguments to slash commands. Design your command to:
- Accept optional arguments
- Provide default behavior when no arguments are given
- Validate argument types and formats
- Give clear error messages for invalid arguments

### Step 5: Test and Iterate
- Test the command in different contexts
- Verify argument handling works correctly
- Ensure the command produces consistent, useful results
- Refine based on usage patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Commands Focused
- Each command should have a single, clear purpose
- Avoid trying to do too many things in one command
- Create multiple specialized commands rather than one complex one

### 2. Make Commands Context-Aware
- Use current file content when relevant
- Consider project structure and conventions
- Adapt behavior based on file type or project type

### 3. Provide Clear Instructions
- Write detailed, unambiguous instructions for Claude
- Specify expected output format
- Include examples when helpful

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- Consider what happens with empty files
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully
- Provide fallback behavior for unexpected situations

### 5. Documentation and Naming
- Use descriptive command names
- Include clear documentation within the command file
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions

## Example: Generic Code Analysis Command

```markdown
# Analyze Code Structure

## Purpose
Analyze the current file or specified files for code structure, patterns, and potential improvements.

## Parameters
- `{target}`: Optional - specific file or directory to analyze (defaults to current file)
- `{depth}`: Optional - analysis depth level (shallow, normal, deep)

## Instructions
1. Examine the target code file(s)
2. Identify code patterns, structure, and architecture
3. Look for potential improvements or issues
4. Provide a structured analysis report including:
   - Code organization assessment
   - Potential refactoring opportunities
   - Code quality observations
   - Suggestions for improvement

## Context Usage
- If no target specified, analyze the currently open file
- Consider project context for framework-specific analysis
- Use appropriate analysis depth based on file size and complexity
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Conditional Logic
Include conditional instructions based on argument values:
```markdown
If {mode} is "quick":
- Provide brief summary only
If {mode} is "detailed":
- Include comprehensive analysis with examples
```

### 2. Multi-Step Processing
Design commands that work in phases:
```markdown
1. First, analyze the current context
2. Then, based on findings, determine appropriate action
3. Finally, execute the action and report results
```

### 3. Integration with Other Tools
Commands can leverage Claude Code's tool ecosystem:
- File system operations
- Git operations
- External API calls
- Code execution

## Common Patterns

### 1. File Processing Commands
Commands that work with files in the current directory or specified paths.

### 2. Code Generation Commands
Commands that create boilerplate code based on patterns or specifications.

### 3. Analysis Commands
Commands that examine existing code and provide insights or suggestions.

### 4. Refactoring Commands
Commands that transform existing code according to specific patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
- Check file location and naming
- Verify file permissions
- Ensure proper file extension (.md)

### Arguments Not Working
- Review argument parsing in command template
- Check for typos in parameter names
- Verify argument format matches expectations

### Inconsistent Results
- Add more specific instructions
- Include examples in the command template
- Consider edge cases and add handling for them

## Conclusion

Building effective generic slash commands requires careful planning, clear documentation, and iterative refinement. Focus on creating focused, well-documented commands that can adapt to different contexts while maintaining consistent, useful behavior.

The key to success is balancing flexibility with clarityâ€”make commands generic enough to be reusable while specific enough to produce reliable results.
